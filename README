Unicontsoft Fiscal Printers Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UcsFP is a COM component that can be used to configure and operate 
fiscal printers that are popular in Bulgaria. The component supports
printing fiscal and non-fiscal receipts, printing daily reports as well
as configuring device settings (usually done by registered companies).

UcsFP implements lowest-level protocols that are supported by the fiscal
printers, usually sending native commands directly to the COM port the
device is attached to.

UcsFP supports remoting through COM+ so a single fiscal device can be
used by multiple workstations.

Currently supported devices by manufacturers:
 - Datecs (http://www.datecs.bg)
 - Eltrade (http://www.eltrade.com)
 - Tremol (http://www.tremol.bg)
 - Daisy (http://www.daisytech.com/)

UcsFP is tested on the following models:
 - FP550, FP3530 (in production)
 - Eltrade A300 (in production)
 - Zeka ZM03 (development only)
 - Daisy Micro (development only)

Enjoy!
